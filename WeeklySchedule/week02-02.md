#Week 2, Day 2
##Telling Stories with a Timeline

### Assignments

**Before Class**

- Read: Lena Groeger of ProPublica on Making Timelines. Her [2013 presentation to NICAR](http://lenagroeger.s3.amazonaws.com/timelines/timelines.html), the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting, and her [2015 NICAR presentation](http://lenagroeger.s3.amazonaws.com/talks/nicar-2015/timelines-nicar/timelines.html)
- View: [Examples of TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#examples), noting the combination of image, text and time, such as [How Wine Colonized the World](http://vinepair.com/wine-colonized-world-wine-history/#1)

**After Class**

- Read this wiki about [how to organize a timeline](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Timeline)

###Principles

- Time is at the core of journalism. The linguistic roots of the word "journalism" are tied to the word, "day." 
- Timelines are natural ways to tell stories, especially about changes over time, from the history of a university to the story of someone's life
- Timelines had been difficult to construct. But the Knight Lab created a beautiful tool: TimelineJS. It continues to be improved and we will work with TimelineJS 3.

###Practice

- In-Class Exercise
  - Review again: [Examples of TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#examples), noting the combination of image, text and time
  - Next: we will study the spreadsheet at the heart of the Timeline and most data visualizations. The [Timeline spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/a/lehigh.edu/previewtemplate?id=1pHBvXN7nmGkiG8uQSUB82eNlnL8xHu6kydzH_-eguHQ&mode=public#) is based in Google Drive and is quite specific in its structure. Here is a [discussion of the spreadsheet](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/using-spreadsheets.html).
  - We will use links to photos and text to complete the [4-step TimelineJS tutorial](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#make), including the Optional Settings in Step 3. We will want to pay attention to photo credits.
  - [Rio 2016](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gpgFkYiFS0k/V2PgaYiIIWI/AAAAAAAAAGg/iP_5APptn2Yoy-irza5E4unZTHJSPIg9QCLcB/s1600/Rio%2B2016%2BOlympics%2BOpening%2BCeremony.jpeg)
  - [Concern that Rio would be ready](https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/water-pollution-rio-olympics.jpeg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1100)
  - [Athletes march in](http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2016/08/rio_olympics_opening_ceremony-12.jpg)
  - [Rio opening ceremony](http://images.indianexpress.com/2016/08/maracana-main.jpg)
  - Timeline produces an iframe embed code. Use TextEdit to create an html page with the embed code and publish the TimelineJS draft to name.github.io

### Assignment

- Construct your own TimelineJS, using 6-10 photos or videos
- Publish the TimelineJS on an html page to your name.github.io
