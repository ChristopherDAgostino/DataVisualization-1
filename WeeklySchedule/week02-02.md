###Chart Exercise: In Class

Finally we will learn how to upload a chart to GitHub and display it on your github.io pages.
<li><a href="http://jacklule.github.io/pages/SVGtest.html">Here is Chartbuilder in svg format.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jacklule.github.io/pages/PNGtest.html">Here is Chartbuilder in png format.</a></li>

<p>1) Create chart in Chartbuilder</p>
<p>2) Export or Save as SVG to local computer with simple name, no spaces; you can also use png but png sometimes has trouble displaying</p>
<p>3) Put file in local github.io folder</p>
<p>4) Commit -- Sync -- with GitHub site</p>
<p>5) Create an html page with a brief heading to display your svg file</p>
<p>6) If you have not already set up TextEdit for html creation, see Week 1. (Create in TextEdit. Save as plain text file unicode 8 and add html to Save. Make sure file is in github.io folder. Then Commit-Sync with website.)</p>
<p>7) Go to your github.io site and find the link for "Copy Path" of file; place the link on a display page at your github.io site; don't forget http, if it is not included.</p>

<p><b>You are now publishing your own web pages at your github.io site!</b></p>
