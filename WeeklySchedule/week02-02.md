##Telling Stories with a Timeline

Time is at the core of journalism.

James Carey wrote a splendid essay on the role of time in journalism.

Timelines are natural ways to tell stories. [Lena Groeger on timelines](http://lenagroeger.s3.amazonaws.com/timelines/timelines.html). 

They had been difficult to construct. But the Knight Lab created a beautiful tool: TimelineJS. 

Let's explore:

###In-Class Exercise

- First, we will study [Examples of TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#examples)
- Next: we will study the spreadsheet at the heart of the Timeline and most data visualizations. The [Timeline spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/a/lehigh.edu/previewtemplate?id=1pHBvXN7nmGkiG8uQSUB82eNlnL8xHu6kydzH_-eguHQ&mode=public#) is based in Google Drive and is quite specific in its structure. Here is a [discussion of the spreadsheet](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/using-spreadsheets.html).
- We will use sample photos and text to complete [4-step TimelineJS tutorial](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#make), including the Optional Settings in Step 3.
- Then use TextEdit to create an html page and publish the TimelineJS draft to name.github.io

### Assignment
- Read this wiki piece about [how to organize a timeline](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Timeline)
- Construct your own TimelineJS, using at least 10 photos or videos
- Publish the TimelineJS on an html page to your name.github.io.
