#Week 2, Day 2
##Telling Stories with a Timeline

### Assignments

**Before Class**

- Read: [Lena Groeger on Making Timelines](http://lenagroeger.s3.amazonaws.com/timelines/timelines.html), with discussions of TimelineJS and Vertical Timeline

**After Class**

- Read this wiki about [how to organize a timeline](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Timeline)
- [Best Practices for Data Viz](http://www.slideshare.net/idigdata/data-visualization-best-practices-2013) 36 slides

Time is at the core of journalism.

James Carey wrote a splendid essay on the role of time in journalism.

Timelines are natural ways to tell stories, especially about changes over time, from the history of a university to the story of someone's life. 

Timelines had been difficult to construct. But the Knight Lab created a beautiful tool: TimelineJS. It continues to be improved and we will work with TimelineJS 3.

Let's explore:

###In-Class Exercise

- First, we will study [Examples of TimelineJS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#examples), noting the combination of image, text and time.
- Next: we will study the spreadsheet at the heart of the Timeline and most data visualizations. The [Timeline spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/a/lehigh.edu/previewtemplate?id=1pHBvXN7nmGkiG8uQSUB82eNlnL8xHu6kydzH_-eguHQ&mode=public#) is based in Google Drive and is quite specific in its structure. Here is a [discussion of the spreadsheet](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/using-spreadsheets.html).
- We will use links to Lehigh photos and text to complete the [4-step TimelineJS tutorial](https://timeline.knightlab.com/index.html#make), including the Optional Settings in Step 3. We will want to pay attention to photo credits.
- Timeline produces an iframe embed code. Use TextEdit to create an html page with the embed code and publish the TimelineJS draft to name.github.io

### Assignment

- Construct your own TimelineJS, using 6-10 photos or videos
- Publish the TimelineJS on an html page to your name.github.io.
