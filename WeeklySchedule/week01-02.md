##Creating an html page with a text editor

- To create an html page with TextEdit in Mac: You need first to edit preferences in Mac's Apple TextEdit.
- <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ta20406?locale=en_US">Apple Support: How to Set Up TextEdit.</a> Under Preferences, Click the Plain Text radio button for New Document Format. Under Saving, click the checkbox to turn off "Append '.txt' extension to plain text files."
- [Creating an html page](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
- If you need to edit the html page in TextEdit later: Under TextEdit, find Preferences, go to the “Open and Save” tab, check the box, “Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text.” Also, under "New Document," make TextEdit default to "plain text" (instead of "rich text").
- Posting the page to GitHub: pull, commit, sync

##Assignments: FlowingData by Nathan Yau

- Browse through recent data-visualizations by any publication of your choosing. Pick one particular visualization, and write about what you find: What does it show? What works? What doesn't?
- FlowingData is a great website and resource written by Nathan Yau, who also has some key books on working with data.
- Here is a 44-page sample chapter, "Representing Data," from Yau's excellent book, Data Points.
- ["Representing Data" from Data Points](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0fVXql3uCOpcXdONzBsUE1qcmc)
