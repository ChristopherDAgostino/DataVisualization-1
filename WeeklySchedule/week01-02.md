#Week 1, Day 2
##Telling Stories with Data

###Review syllabus

###Practice

**In class**: [Setting up GitHub hosting pages, github.io](https://pages.github.com/)

See annotations at [class GitHub Setup Guide](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md), scroll down to Day 2

Also see, [Creating an html page](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
- If you need to edit the html page in TextEdit later: Under TextEdit, find Preferences, go to the “Open and Save” tab, check the box, “Display HTML files as HTML code instead of formatted text.” Also, under "New Document," make TextEdit default to "plain text" (instead of "rich text").
- Posting the page to GitHub: pull, commit, sync

###Assignments: Customize the GitHub Page 
Directions can also be found at our [class GitHub Setup Guide](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md)

Remembering that the page eventually will be their GitHub portfolio, students should follow these steps:

- Students should have already **set up their repo site at github.io**, using the directions above and at [Git Hub Pages guide above](https://pages.github.com/)
- After creating username.github.io, students can personalize that page;
- They should go to page --- username.github.io -- and find the **setting** link to the top right;
- Scroll down to Update site and click on Automatic Page Generator;
- provide a straightforward page name: name.github.io
- provide a brief tagline of description;
- scroll past generic text and continue to Layout; 
- I chose Minimal but students can pick from other styles;
- the repo/portfolio page is now customized;
- Students can then go to their index page, remove the generic GitHug text and begin providjng their own content;
- Here is the result for me at [my GitHub Page](http://jacklule.github.io/)

###Advanced: Creating folders within GitHub

- go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder
- click on New file
- on the text field for creating the file name, after the /, type the *folder* name you want to create and hit Enter
- on the next text field to the right, after the /, type the *file* name (type .md if you want that style) and hit Enter
- this creates a folder.

###Assignments: FlowingData by Nathan Yau

- Browse through recent data-visualizations by any publication of your choosing. Pick one particular visualization, and write about what you find: What does it show? What works? What doesn't?
- FlowingData is a great website and resource written by Nathan Yau, who also has some key books on working with data.
- Here is a 44-page sample chapter, "Representing Data," from Yau's excellent book, Data Points.
- ["Representing Data" from Data Points](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0fVXql3uCOpcXdONzBsUE1qcmc)
