# Week 3, Day 2 
##Telling Stories with the Humble Chart

We continue our exploration and work with the "two workhorses" of data visualization: the bar chart and the line chart.

**In Class**

**Getting more comfortable with html**

With the fear factor of coding now gone, let's look more closely at an html page:
- W3 Schools provides a [great introduction to html](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)

**Intro to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets in html)**
- Open your previously submitted infographic.html file in github.com
- study the code once more
- Follow this straightforward [w3schools tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp). Scroll down to Inline CSS and use the simple instructions to change the font color of your heading to blue.

We will next create and upload a chart to GitHub and display it on your github.io pages.
<li><a href="http://jacklule.github.io/pages/SVGtest.html">Here is Chartbuilder in svg format.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jacklule.github.io/pages/PNGtest.html">Here is Chartbuilder in png format.</a></li>

**Question: What were the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's undergraduate colleges in 2015?**
- Find the data from Lehigh's [Fall 2015 institutional profile](http://www.lehigh.edu/~oir/profiles/profile_files/LUprofile_2015.pdf).
- Create a spreadsheet in Google docs with two columns: College and 2015 Percent of Undergraduate Enrollment.
- Copy that spreadsheet and create a column bar chart in Chartbuilder that shows the percentage of undergraduate enrollment per college. 
- Check [Anatomy of a Chart](http://www.lamivo.com/tipsheets/anatomy_chart.pdf) to make sure you have the essential elements.

**Steps for uploading through GitHub.com**
<p>1) Review the chart on Lehigh undergraduate enrollment per college. </p>
<p>2) Export as Image (png file -- portable network graphic) or svg file (scalable vector graphic, used for interactivity) 
<p>3) The file will download to local computer. Rename to a single name, no spaces</p>
<p>4) At github.com, upload the file to your name.github.io repository</p>
<p>5) Create New File -- include .html in the name -- and create html page, perhaps adapting the code from your infographic html page. Be sure to use the exact name of your uploaded file when putting it into the page</p>
<p>6) Copy file path and check if the chart appears in your browser</p>

**Steps for uploading through GitHub Desktop**
<p>1) Create chart in Chartbuilder</p>
<p>2) Export or Save as SVG to local computer with simple name, no spaces; you can also use png but png sometimes has trouble displaying</p>
<p>3) Put file in local github.io folder</p>
<p>4) Commit -- Sync -- with GitHub site</p>
<p>5) Create an html page with a brief heading to display your svg file</p>
<p>6) If you have not already set up TextEdit for html creation, see Week 1. (Create in TextEdit. Save as plain text file unicode 8 and add html to Save. Make sure file is in github.io folder. Then Commit-Sync with website.)</p>
<p>7) Go to your github.io site and find the link for "Copy Path" of file; place the link on a display page at your github.io site; don't forget http, if it is not included.</p>

**After Class**

**Question: What are the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's three undergraduate colleges over the past ten years?**
- Find the data for ten years of Lehigh's [institutional profile](http://www.lehigh.edu/~oir/profiles/profile.htm). You will be using the html version that has 12 years of Lehigh profiles in tabs at the bottom.
- Create a spreadsheet in Google docs that has four columns: Year, Arts & Sciences, Business and Engineering.
- Only collect the data for Arts & Sciences, Business and Engineering from 2006 to 2015 and enter it into a spreadsheet in Google Docs. This will take about 12 minutes.
- Copy that spreadsheet and create a line graph/time-series chart in Chartbuilder that shows the changes in percentage of undergraduate enrollment per college per year. 
- Download the chart from Charterbuilder, upload to name.github.io and create an html page.
- Please send me a link to that page.
