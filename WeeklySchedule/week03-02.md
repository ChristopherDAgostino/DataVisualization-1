### Post-class assignments

- If the data for your long-term project has a geographic component, map it with either Fusion Tables. If not, do the same for either the FEC data from Week 5 or the Facebook data from Week 8. Is this data better presented as a map, or some other sort of visualization? Explain why.

###Want to Dig Deeper?

- Reference maps are what you use when you drive. Thematic maps are what you see in the news. The maps are based on themes -- child mortality, Democrat or Republican, gun ownership, income. 
- Ken Schwencke gave a two-hour tutorial, {Getting Started with Mapping](http://forjournalism.github.io/courses/mapping/) that gets into django and other tools.
