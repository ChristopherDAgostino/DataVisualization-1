## Practice: In Class

- **In class exercise**:
  - [Canva tutorials](https://designschool.canva.com/tutorials/). Students will need to register at Canva. 
  - [Beginner](https://www.canva.com/design/DABt7NIMOCI/XaP1zkyMrDH-rlB7LvuB3g/edit): 3 minutes
  - [Essential Canva Tools](https://www.canva.com/design/DABruYYnUZk/KmFa2-jSqTcKj5zUT-s9Cw/edit): 10 minutes
  - Focus on layout, design, font and color
  - [Canva sample on HTML5 page](https://madisonhoff.github.io/infographic.html)
  - **In class exercise**:
  - for class exercise do infographic on [percentage of tri-state undergraduate students at Lehigh](http://www.lehigh.edu/~oir/profiles/profile.htm)
  - will create this [simple page](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/canvanortheast.html). Here is what it can look like [with a map](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/northeast.html) uploaded and made transparent
- **To create Canva infographic from template** 
  -   Choose create design and top left choose square social media template
  -   leave layout blank but choose grey background
  -   add title but use subheading for smaller font; drag it to the top of the template
  -   under Elements, choose text and at top left change color to black; type in stats
  -   in top bar, click to change title; at bottom add the source of information
- **To upload Canva infographic to name.github.io**
  - download as png file to computer
  - default title will be name of infographic
  - open in Finder and give the infographic a one-word name.
  - open https://github.com/name/name.github.io and click upload file
  - drag or choose png file and commit
- **To create an html page to display your infographic**
  - select create New File at name.github.io
  - give file one-word name **with .html after the name**
  - in the text box, enter:
  - **(enter < and > before and after each line where needed so it will appear as html)**
  - !DOCTYPE HTML>
  - html>
  - body>
  - body topmargin="50">
  - body leftmargin="50">
  - h1> Infographic Title Different from Title on Infographic</h1
  - h2>Your Name</h2
  - img class="pretty" src=infographicname.png style="width: 75%"> **(make sure infographic name is exact, including lower case)**
  - /body>
  - /html>
- Commit
 - Trouble? Check your html by looking at Page Source (right click on PCs; Option+Command+u for Macs)
- To check: click Copy File Path and view infographic in browser

## Practice: Out of Class: Graded Assignment
- find a story using data from this source: Lehigh Office of Institutional Research [Census](http://www.lehigh.edu/~oir/census.html)
- Create an infographic, upload it to your github.io site and create an html page to showcase the infographic
- Be sure to follow our [Grading Rubic](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/Grading%20Rubric.md), with attention to typos, source information and more, to get the maximum 10 points
