#Week 4, Day 2
## Telling Stories with Maps

### Assignments

**Before Class**

- [Best Practices in Maps, by CartoDB](http://docs.cartodb.com/tips-and-tricks/best-practices-checklist/), now CARTO; good, clear
- [ESRI Map Checklist](http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0911/making-a-map-meaningful.html), detailed narrative
- [What's Useful about Mapping](http://kpq.github.io/sherp-31/assets/lectures/lecture2-2013.pdf), slides by Kevin Quealy, graphics editor for the NY Times

**After Class**

- [So You Want To Make a Map...](https://github.com/veltman/learninglunches/tree/master/maps), by Noah Veltman, 2013, a nice intro to geodata terms and numbers (on GitHub)
- [Simple map exercise](https://github.com/cshirky/SimpleMapping/blob/master/Lesson1.md) from Clay Shirky on GitHub, showing xyz axis using Google maps. 
- Do a Google search: What are the coordinates for Lehigh University. Put the coordinates into a browser window. 
####ESRI and ArcGIS

###In-Class Exercise


###Resources

- [ESRI Mapping Basics](http://www.esri.com/connected#Mapping%20Our%20World), very possible to use this in classes as well as Google Fusion
- [Journalists Embrace ESRI Story Maps](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2015/07/06/journalists-embrace-story-maps/)
- [ESRI Story Maps](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/)
- Brief [instructions for an ESRI Story Map](http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0513/make-a-map-tour-story-map)
- My example of a [South Side Story Map](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/ESRIMapStory.html)

####CartoDB
- [The Map Academy: Online Mapping for Beginners -- 5 Lessons](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/beginners-course/), a steeper learning curve than ESRI and Google Fusion
- [The Map Academy: Introduction to Map Design -- 4 Lessons](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/design-for-beginners/)

####StorymapJS
- [StorymapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/), track events across a map; not as powerful as Google Fusion, Carto or ESRI
- 
####Stately
-[Stately](https://intridea.github.io/stately/), U.S. state mapping

### Reading

- [Axis Maps has an excellent Thematic Cartography Guide on GitHub](http://axismaps.github.io/thematic-cartography/)
- [When Maps Shouldnâ€™t Be Maps](http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/), by Matthew Ericson, 2011
- [So You Want To Make a Map...](https://github.com/veltman/learninglunches/tree/master/maps), by Noah Veltman, 2013
- [Mapping where English is not the language at home](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/us-language-map/), by Dan Keating and Darla Cameron, 2013
- [crime.chicagotribune.com](http://crime.chicagotribune.com/), by the Chicago Tribune News Apps Team, ongoing

###Assignment
- In-class: create a map story with ESRI or CartoDB

### Post-class assignments

- Add to your map

###Want to Dig Deeper?

- Reference maps are what you use when you drive. Thematic maps are what you see in the news. The maps are based on themes -- child mortality, Democrat or Republican, gun ownership, income. 
- Ken Schwencke gave a two-hour tutorial to ONA, [Getting Started with Mapping](http://forjournalism.github.io/courses/mapping/) that gets into django and other tools.
