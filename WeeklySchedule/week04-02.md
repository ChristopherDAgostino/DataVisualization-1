#Week 4, Day 2
## Telling Stories with Maps

### Assignments

**Before Class**
- [Axis Maps has an excellent Thematic Cartography Guide on GitHub](http://axismaps.github.io/thematic-cartography/), read General Map Making Topics

**After Class**

- [Crime Mapping at the Chicago Tribune](http://crime.chicagotribune.com/), by the Chicago Tribune News Apps Team, ongoing

###In-Class Exercise

- Google Fusion exercise with local data
- Demonstrate how to get URLs of images from Google: Search>Images>View Image (get photo credit)
- Open Google Fusion tutorial; we will first review and then use a local spreadsheet
- Open [spreadsheet on local arts centers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IuaZxQf0zKPVXZZbs7VJKQWG4ePLbf-utVQ8ueN7Eg0/edit?usp=sharing), created at Google Sheets
- Click grey folder next to name J 24 Google Fusion Data Sample. Move to your Google Drive.
- Add information to a fifth establishment to practice adding data. Find address, URL and image for ArtsQuest in Bethlehem
- 101 Founders Way, Bethlehem, PA 18015	ArtsQuest Center	http://www.artsquest.org/	Indie movie theater, bar, restaurant	http://lehighvalleytechfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/steelstacksV08_11_139.jpg																					row
- at the bottom of Select a Spreadsheet, paste the web address
- Go to Map of Names
- under Configure, can change type of icon
- under Change Info Window, edit card to remove unecessary titles: Name, URL, Address, Description, Image

**Troubleshoot**
- When spreadsheet first opened in Google Fusion, the tab said Map of Name, not Map of Location; map did not work
- In Gooogle Fusion Row Tab: Click in Location cell for dropdown menu. Click Change. Change Type from Text to Location. Repeat steps with Name cell. Change from Location to Text. Map should now say Map of Location and should work.

**To Publish**
- Click Done on Map.
- Must make map accessible (the default is private).
- Click the Share button.
- You'll see a list of who has access to the table. Find "Private" and click Change.
- Select the Public or "Anyone with the link" radio button under Visibility options.
- Click Save. The change is effective immediately.
- Click Done. The maps is now accessible.
- Go to Tools > Publish and get iframe html code to embed.
- Create map.html page at github.com to embed the iframe code for the map.

###Assignment

- Create your own spreadsheet and Google Fusion map with at least five locations.
- publish to an html page at github.com and send me the link

###Resources

- [Telling Stories with Google Maps](https://sites.google.com/site/geomedialab/exercise-1)
- [Mapping where English is not the language at home](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/us-language-map/), by Dan Keating and Darla Cameron, 2013
- Ken Schwencke gave a two-hour tutorial to ONA, [Getting Started with Mapping](http://forjournalism.github.io/courses/mapping/) that gets into django and other tools.

###Other Mapping Tools

**ESRI and ArcGIS**
  - [ESRI Mapping Basics](http://www.esri.com/connected#Mapping%20Our%20World), very possible to use this in classes as well as Google Fusion
  - [Journalists Embrace ESRI Story Maps](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2015/07/06/journalists-embrace-story-maps/)
  - [ESRI Story Maps](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/)
  - Brief [instructions for an ESRI Story Map](http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0513/make-a-map-tour-story-map)
  - My example of a [South Side Story Map](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/ESRIMapStory.html)

**Carto**
  - [The Map Academy: Online Mapping for Beginners -- 5 Lessons](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/beginners-course/), a steeper learning curve than ESRI and Google Fusion
  - [The Map Academy: Introduction to Map Design -- 4 Lessons](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/design-for-beginners/)

**StorymapJS**
- [StorymapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/), track events across a map; not as powerful as Google Fusion, Carto or ESRI
 
**Stately**
-[Stately](https://intridea.github.io/stately/), U.S. state mapping
