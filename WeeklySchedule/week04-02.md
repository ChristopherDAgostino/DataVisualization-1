#Week 4, Day 2
## Telling Stories with Maps

####ESRI and ArcGIS
- [ESRI Mapping Basics](http://www.esri.com/connected#Mapping%20Our%20World), very possible to use this in classes as well as Google Fusion
- [Journalists Embrace ESRI Story Maps](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2015/07/06/journalists-embrace-story-maps/)
- [ESRI Story Maps](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/)
- Brief [instructions for an ESRI Story Map](http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0513/make-a-map-tour-story-map)
- My example of a [South Side Story Map](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/ESRIMapStory.html)

####CartoDB
- [The Map Academy: Online Mapping for Beginners -- 5 Lessons](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/beginners-course/), a steeper learning curve than ESRI and Google Fusion
- [The Map Academy: Introduction to Map Design -- 4 Lessons](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/design-for-beginners/)

####StorymapJS
- [StorymapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/), track events across a map; not as powerful as Google Fusion, Carto or ESRI
- 
####Stately
-[Stately](https://intridea.github.io/stately/), U.S. state mapping

###Want to Dig Deeper?

- Reference maps are what you use when you drive. Thematic maps are what you see in the news. The maps are based on themes -- child mortality, Democrat or Republican, gun ownership, income. 
- Ken Schwencke gave a two-hour tutorial to ONA, [Getting Started with Mapping](http://forjournalism.github.io/courses/mapping/) that gets into django and other tools.
