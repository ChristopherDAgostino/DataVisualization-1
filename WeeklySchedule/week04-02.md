#Week 4, Day 2
## Telling Stories with Maps

### Assignments

**Before Class**
- [Axis Maps has an excellent Thematic Cartography Guide on GitHub](http://axismaps.github.io/thematic-cartography/), read General Map Making Topics

**After Class**

- [Crime Mapping at the Chicago Tribune](http://crime.chicagotribune.com/), by the Chicago Tribune News Apps Team, ongoing


###In-Class Exercise

- Google Fusion exercise with local data

###Resources

- [Mapping where English is not the language at home](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/us-language-map/), by Dan Keating and Darla Cameron, 2013
- Ken Schwencke gave a two-hour tutorial to ONA, [Getting Started with Mapping](http://forjournalism.github.io/courses/mapping/) that gets into django and other tools.

###Other Mapping Tools

**ESRI and ArcGIS**
  - [ESRI Mapping Basics](http://www.esri.com/connected#Mapping%20Our%20World), very possible to use this in classes as well as Google Fusion
  - [Journalists Embrace ESRI Story Maps](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/esri-insider/2015/07/06/journalists-embrace-story-maps/)
  - [ESRI Story Maps](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/)
  - Brief [instructions for an ESRI Story Map](http://www.esri.com/esri-news/arcwatch/0513/make-a-map-tour-story-map)
  - My example of a [South Side Story Map](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/ESRIMapStory.html)

**Carto**
  - [The Map Academy: Online Mapping for Beginners -- 5 Lessons](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/beginners-course/), a steeper learning curve than ESRI and Google Fusion
  - [The Map Academy: Introduction to Map Design -- 4 Lessons](http://academy.cartodb.com/courses/design-for-beginners/)

**StorymapJS**
- [StorymapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/), track events across a map; not as powerful as Google Fusion, Carto or ESRI
 
**Stately**
-[Stately](https://intridea.github.io/stately/), U.S. state mapping
