# Week 1, Day 1
## Telling Stories with Data

### Principles

- Structure of Jour 24 (and Jour 23).
- Goal: Telling Stories with Data
- Principles (long lasting) and Practice (always evolving)
- Fixing the hole in your resume
- [Concept Table](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/ConceptTable.md) for review of readings, quizzes and tests
- For example, names such as Playfair, Snow, Tufte, Gosling, Cairo; concepts such as infographics, git, pull and md.

### Practice: Finding Data
- Your friend, the spreadsheet
- **In class**: [Finding Data](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data_0.html)
- Also see for the U.S., [data.gov](http://www.data.gov/), [data.gov/states](https://www.data.gov/states/), [Northampton County, PA Census Data](http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/42/42095.html), the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org), the [United Nations](http://data.un.org), [GetTheData](http://getthedata.org), and city, county, state and federal databases
- More [data sources from Visual.ly](http://blog.visual.ly/data-sources/)
- Nice list of [Data Tools](http://selection.datavisualization.ch/)

###Practice: Visualizing Data
- Visualization choices: infographics, timelines, charts, maps, storymaps, documentaries and comics. Eventually we will add considerations of interactivity and mobile.
- Our tools: GitHub; Chartbuilder; Google Fusion; CartoDB; Tableau.
- **In class**: The difference between infographics and data visualization: [Alberto Cairo](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2014/03/infographics-to-reveal-visualizations.html), [Robert Kosara](https://eagereyes.org/blog/2010/the-difference-between-infographics-and-visualization)

###Getting Started with GitHub

- Introduction to GitHub
- **In class**: Register for and Set up GitHub. [Our Class GitHub Setup Instructions](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md)
- **In class**: [Setting up GitHub hosting pages, github.io](https://pages.github.com/)
- Difference between .md pages and html pages
- [md Markdown basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) and [special Markdown tricks with GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/)

###Creating folders within GitHub

- go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder
- click on New file
- on the text field for creating the file name, after the /, type the *folder* name you want to create and hit Enter
- on the next text field to the right, after the /, type the *file* name (type .md if you want that style) and hit Enter
- this creates a folder.
