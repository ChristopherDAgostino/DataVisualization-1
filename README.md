# DataViz-Syllabus
A first draft for a Fall 2016 Data Viz module in Lehigh University journalism.

I am thinking of using GitHub to create, and perhaps to host, my syllabus for a new Fall 2016 class, Data Visualization.
The class will actually be part of a larger, current class, Jour 24 Visual Communication. If the experiment works, Jour 24 will have seven weeks of traditional visual communication and seven weeks of data visualization. A companion course, Jour 23 Editing and Critical Thinking, will have seven weeks of traditional editing and seven weeks of data journalism.

My decision to use GitHub is so students will get to know this site and some fundamental coding even as they work on the class.
