# DataViz-Syllabus
First draft for Fall 2016 Data Viz class
I am thinking of using GitHub to create, and perhaps to host, my syllabus for a new Fall 2016 class, Data Visualization.
The class will actually be part of a larger, current class, Jour 24 Visual Communication. If the experiment works, Jour 24 will have seven weeks of traditional visual communication and seven weeks of data visualization.
My decision to use GitHub is so students will get to know this site even as they work on the class.
