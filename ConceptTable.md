####Meta-comment
Tables are easy to create with ["GitHub Flavored Markdown."](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)
Much easier than creating a table in html. Be sure to name the page with .md. 

In html, I would have needed more tags such as html, body, table border=“1”, style="width:50%", and then, after each line, tr for table row, td for table data. I also struggled to get the table cell width right.

<html>
<body>

<h4>Concept table done in html</h4>

<table border=“1”>
  <tr>
    <td>William Playfair</td>
    <td>John Snow</td>		
    <td>Edward Tufte</td>
    <td>Alberto Cairo</td>
    <td>Simon Rogers</td>		
    <td>theguardian.com/data</td>
    <td>KnowMore</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>data</td>
  <td>data visualization</td>
  <td>infographic</td>
  <td>GitHub</td>
  <td>md files</td>
  <td>html files</td>
  <td>pull request</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
