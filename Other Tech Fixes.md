<h3> Tech Fixes </h3>

I will place here some random tech fixes that I have used throughout data visualization.

**Dates and Scanning Old Photos**

I have been scanning old photos from the 1940s and 1950s. The "date modified" often is the current date and "date created" is blank or the date modified.

But using an old version of Picasa 3, I was able to change date and time for individual photos or a batch. Picasa 3 > Tools > Adjust Date and Time > Click for all or do individually.
