# Syllabus: JOUR 24 Visual Communication
#Fall 2016

From Alberto Cairo:
- "I think that the future of visualization doesn't depend on the tools we use, but on solid principles."
- "Instead of thinking what the future of visualization will be, I perhaps should talk about what I want the future of news visualization to be."

## Data Visualization Module

The best journalism education has at least three parts:
- A broad and solid liberal arts background
- Basic journalism skills
- Preparation for the digital age

In Lehigh's journalism major, you get all three. In Jour 24 Visual Communication, including this module, you get all three.

In this module, you will learn principles of visual communication that have grounded the liberal arts for centuries. You will learn essential journalism skills, such as working with images and data. You will become familiar with new, but always evolving, digital tools that will help you tell stories with data.

##Data: The hole in your resume

Many of us go into journalism because we want to tell stories. Data are not stories, we think.

In this class, we will find, however, that data is a way to find stories and data visualization is a way to tell stories.

Through data, we will look for patterns. We will see connections. We live in a time when large amounts of important data are available to us -- from university admission rates to poverty rates, from winning percentages to voting percentages. You will be less of a storyteller if you cannot take advantage of data. Others will be able to. You will have a hole in your resume.  

Then, once you see the story in the data, how will you tell the story? Sometimes words and pictures are perfect. Sometimes not. Sometimes you will want to arrange the data visually and create usable and beautiful pieces of information from columns of data. You should know how to do that. If not, you will have a hole in your resume.

Our graduates find work in journalism, media, communication, public relations, marketing, politics, law, health and many other fields. Every single field now wants its employees to understand data and data visualization. If you cannot, you will have a hole in your resume.
