##Getting Set Up at GitHub.com: Day 1

<p>Students of course first need to set up an account. It is easy at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com.</a> 
<p>We will follow along with the <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Git Hub setup guide, "Hello World."</a></p>

My **annotations** for Hello World:
- for **Signup**, students should use their first and last name: jacklule
- before Create a Repository, follow tip to open up Hello World guide in **separate tab** and work in another tab
- also before repository, GitHub will ask, **Please verify email address**; will need to open email
- for repository, no need to name, "Hello World;" can **name Data Viz**
- click Public, click Initialize with ReadMe; notice **ReadMe is md file**
- do Issue and Create Branch, notice **working in branch, not master**; not use often, will work in master, but good practice
- click to access ReadMe (**notice we are in branch**);
- click pencil icon in top right to **edit ReadMe**; practice md and preview as go along
- -write a Commit title or message (**grey default can be written over**)
- can check ReadMe in branch and master to see difference; **master is still unedited; changes have not been pulled in**
- **request a pull**; will not usually make a request of yourself; just work on master; New Pull Request
- as creator of the master branch, you **compare change**; either in grey base box, master>branch; or click on edit link; notice changes in green and red
- click **confirm merge** and **delete branch** to keep things clean

<p>Following those instructions, students should compose a brief ReadMe page in md and practice with markdown.</p>

##Getting Set Up at GitHub.io: Day 2

<p> They then should follow the <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages guide</a>, using "User or organization" site and "GitHub for Mac" to install GitHub on their local computer and set up their .io repository page, which will serve as a Portfolio of their work for the class and for future employers.</p>

<p> To Customize the GitHub Page, remembering that the page eventually will be their GitHub portfolio, students should follow these steps:</p>

- After creating username.github.io, students can personalize that page;
- They should go to page --- username.github.io -- and find the **setting** link to the top right;
- Scroll down to Update site and click on Automatic Page Generator;
- provide a straightforward page name: name.github.io
- provide a brief tagline of description;
- scroll past generic text and continue to Layout; 
- I chose Minimal but students can pick from other styles;
- the repo/portfolio page is now customized;
- Students can then go to their index page, remove the generic GitHug text and begin providjng their own content;
- Here is the result for me at [my GitHub Page](http://jacklule.github.io/)

##To submit assignments, create html pages: Day 2

Students will learn to create a new html page to embed and publish each assignment thus doubling the value of each lesson. To get them set up for submitting assignments:

- Students must **set up their text editor to create html pages**. For the Mac, this means to edit Preferences in Apple TextEdit. [Apple Support: How to Set Up TextEdit](https://support.apple.com/kb/ta20406?locale=en_US). In sum: Under Preferences, Click the Plain Text radio button for New Document Format; Under Saving, click the checkbox to turn off "Append '.txt' extension to plain text files."
- Students should have already **set up their repo site at github.io**, using the directions above and at [Git Hub Pages guide above](https://pages.github.com/)
- **To publish work saved on the local computer**, such as svg files produced by Chartbuilder: 1) Students would complete the assignment at Chartbuilder; 2) download the svg file to their local computer (the other option, png files, do not render consistently); 3) create an html page for the assignment; 4) insert the svg file into the html page; 5) upload the html page to their github.io site. Here are examples of a Chartbuilder assignment in svg and png format: [Chartbuilder svg test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/SVGtest.html) and [Chartbuilder png test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/PNGtest.html)
- **To embed and publish work hosted on sites**, such as Tableau or YouTube: 1) Students would complete the assignment on Tableau; 2) get the embed code at Tableau; 3) create an html page for the assignment; 4) embed the Tableau work into the html page; 5) upload the html page to their github.io site. Here are examples: [You Tube Embed Test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/YouTubeEmbedTest.html) and [Tableau Embed Test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/embed-test-Tableau.html)
- **To "hand in" the assignment**, students would: 1) Copy the file path --"copy path" -- for the assignment page and paste that link into their "Portfolio" page, name.github.io; 2) The students may need to add http:// in front of the assigment file path name on their Portfolio page for the pasted url to work; 3) Students would then notfiy me that the assignment was completed and send me the url for the Portfolio page.
- Again, name.github.io will be **The Portfolio** page, a collection of Data Viz work that can be shared with future employers.

##File and Folder management

Creating folders within GitHub:
- go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder
- click on New file
- on the text field for creatng the file name, after the /, type the *folder* name you want to create and hit Enter
- on the next text field to the right, after the /, type the *file* name (type .md if you want that style) and hit Enter
- this creates a folder.
